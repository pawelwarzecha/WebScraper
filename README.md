Simple web scrapers made for practice

First one - UserBenchmark is an updated version of the scraper I made some time ago. It goes into the https://www.userbenchmark.com/ website and copies the CPU market share data into an excel file
second one - Otodom scrapes the real estate listing from the https://www.otodom.pl/ website and logs it into both an excel file and html file, there is also a properties file that can be edited to change the filters for the real estate listings
